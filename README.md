# Crop Yield Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict crop yield for Cassava, Yam, Maize (Corn), Rice, and Sorghum. The model takes into account various independent variables related to agricultural factors.

## Dependent Variable

- Crop Yield

## Independent Variables

1. **Climate and Weather**
   - Incorporates meteorological data to understand the impact of climate on crop yield.

2. **Soil Quality**
   - Analyzes soil properties and characteristics that influence crop growth.

3. **Water Management**
   - Considers the impact of water availability and irrigation practices on crop yield.

4. **Pest and Disease Control**
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of pest and disease management strategies.

5. **Fertilization**
   - Takes into account the type and amount of fertilizers used for crop nourishment.

6. **Genetics**
   - Considers the genetic characteristics of the crops, exploring how different varieties may affect yield.

## Usage

To utilize the model, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/crop-yield-prediction.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the prediction script:
   ```
   python predict_yield.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is available in the `data` directory. It includes historical information on crop yield and the corresponding independent variables.

## Model Evaluation

The model's performance metrics and evaluation results are documented in the `evaluation.md` file.
